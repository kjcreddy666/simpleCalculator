This is a simple calculator application created in Java using the Swing and AWT libraries. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as handle decimal numbers and unary operations like negation. It provides a graphical user interface for ease of use.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design a calculator using Swing and AWT libraries. The calculator should be capable of performing various arithmetic operations on both integers and floating-point numbers, handle positive and negative numbers, and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Introduction

A calculator is a useful tool for performing mathematical calculations. This calculator application was created using Java Swing and AWT libraries to provide a convenient and intuitive way to perform arithmetic operations. It offers the following features:

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers.
- Decimal point for working with floating-point numbers.
- Clear button to reset the calculator.
- Delete button to remove the last entered character.
- Negation button to toggle the sign of the number.
- Display for showing input and results.

## Algorithm

The program follows a simple algorithm to create the calculator:

1. Create a JFrame (window) for the calculator.
2. Set the title and dimensions of the frame.
3. Create a text field for displaying input and results.
4. Create number and function buttons.
5. Add action listeners to handle button clicks.
6. Arrange the buttons in a grid layout.
7. Implement logic for arithmetic operations, decimal input, and other functionalities.
8. Update the text field accordingly.
9. Set the visibility of the frame.

## Requirements

To run this calculator application, you need the following:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.
3. Swing and AWT libraries (usually included with the JDK)
4. A computer system with a minimum of 2GB RAM and a 2GHz processor

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the JDK installed on your system.
2. Download the source code files.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
4. Compile and run the `Calculator.java` file.

## Usage

1. Launch the calculator application.
2. Use the number buttons to input numbers.
3. Use the function buttons for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), equals (=), clear (Clr), delete (Del), and negation (-).
4. Perform calculations by entering numbers and pressing the appropriate function button.
5. The result will be displayed in the text field.
